    "sear_text": "This volume grew out of a remarkable contemplative seminar on Practices of Compassion held in Hyderabad at the end of January 2016. The event was initiated by Lama Doboom Tulku, organized by World Buddhist Culture Trust and conducted by Professor M. Darrol Bryant. Unlike typical conferences, this event incorporated practices of compassion led by participants from their own spiritual practices. Each day began and ended in silence, the participants sat in silence, danced together, shared spiritual practices and learned from one another. Papers were written and circulated in advance. There was no reading of papers, but only discussion. It proved to be a deeply moving experience of practices of compassion for all the participants.\nAt the end of the seminar, there was a spontaneous conviction that this experience and exploration of compassion should be shared with a wider audience. There were contributions from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jain, Sikh, Jewish, and other spiritual streams. Later some additional contributions were invited as well.\nThe volume is a many-leafed flower exhibiting the rich diversity of practices of compassion found in the human family. It is also a testimony to the centrality of silence as the way to compassion. It is the journey within that manifests in actions without. It is not a conceptual journey but a journey of the heart.

    "sear_text": "Preface : \n\nThe Heart Sutra is well-known for its essential teaching on Wisdom. Following the style of this famous Sutra which was translated into Chinese by the Reverend Xuan-Zang, I have written in Chinese a Sastra  ( Da Bei Buo Luo Mi Duo Xin Yao) to present an essential teaching on Compassion. My purpose in doing so is to help others understand the unification of Wisdom and Compassion based on the Limitless-Oneness of all things.\n\nIn this booklet I present the readers with the following three articles:\nFirst, my English translation of the Reverend Xuan-Zang's Chinese version of the Heart Sutra. This is a revised version of the one contained in my Pureland Daily Practice; the minor revisions simply serve to elucidate the meaning. My original translation was done in August 1989, and the revisions were made on March 30, 1992.\n\nSecond, my English version of the Sastra on Limitless-Oneness Compassion which appeared as the appendix to my book, A Blessed Pilgrimage. It was originally composed on December 6, 1990, and the minor revisions presented here were made on April 5, 1992.\n\nThird, a refined transcript of a talk on The Unification of Wisdom and Compassion given by me to members of the Miami Buddhist Lotus Society on July 29, 1991.\nReaders who are not familiar with Buddhist terminology are advised to first read the talk before reading the Sutra and the Sastra.\n\nYutang Lin\nJuly 18, 1992",

This is particularly true in the Buddhist traditions, which unanimously state that compassion and love are the foundation of all paths of practice. To cultivate the potential for compassion and love inherent within us, it is crucial to counteract their opposing forces of anger and hatred. \nIn this book, the Dalai Lama shows how through the practice of patience and tolerance we can overcome the obstacles of anger and hatred. He bases his discussion on A Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of Life, the classic work on the activities of Bodhisattvas—those who aspire to attain full enlightenment in order to benefit all beings.",

    "sear_text": "Not only was Lama Yeshe one of the most beloved Tibetan Buddhist masters of the late twentieth century, he was also a remarkably effective teacher and communicator. In Becoming the Compassion Buddha, just as he did with his bestselling Introduction to Tantra, he once again demonstrates his extraordinary ability to present practices that once were considered arcane or hidden in a way that is clear and understandable to the general reader.\nIn these pages, Lama Yeshe guides readers through the tantric practice of Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion, basing his instructions on a text written by His Holiness the Dalai Lama at age nineteen. He gives special emphasis to mahamudra, the emptiness of one's own mind, and demystifies these esoteric techniques, clearly showing them for what they are: highly developed psychology. Throughout, Lama Yeshe presents his approachable teachings by drawing on examples from daily life and introducing meditation practices that all can follow. Becoming the Compassion Buddha is an extraordinary book that opens new doors for countless readers.",
