Impressed by the qualities of the disciples, he decided to become one himself.\n\nOnce Marpa had practiced and mastered Naropa’s teachings he returned to Lhodrag in south Tibet and spent several years translating Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Tibetan. He returned to India and learned from Naropa and from great masters such as Maitripa and others. He had a number of outstanding disciples. The most important among them for the Kagyu lineage was the great yogi Milarepa.",
