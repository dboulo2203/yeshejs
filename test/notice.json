            "ffnn_text": "Preface : Peace is a Simple Step brings together material that forms a foundation to\nAjahn Sumedho's teachings, from talks that were given in the late 1970s\nand early 1980s. It is a collection made up of three books - Cittaviveka,\nTeachings from the Forest and The Four Noble Truths.\nOf these, Cittaviveka was the first to be printed. It was put together\nin 1983 at the request of supporters who asked for a book about the\nmonastery. Hence the title, and the fact that the first edition also\ncontained narrative pieces - a brief history of the events that led to and\nincluded the arrival of Ajahn Sumedho and his sangha in West Sussex,\nan account of the first bhikkhu upasampadà (Admission to the Sangha)\nin Britain, and an account of the first tudong walk in Britain. The rest of\nthe book comprised articles that had been published in The Middle Way\n(the journal of the Buddhist Society of London) and freshly transcribed\nmaterial. This text was assembled using a typewriter, as computer word\nprocessors had not come into sangha use at that time. It was created in\nabout three weeks, and because of this and other factors, was not very\nthoroughly edited and designed. A second edition was created that\nincluded Ajahn Sumedho's talk on metta. Subsequently, the book was\nredesigned without the section on tudong, and with amendments to the historical account in order to address later developments. In this\nedition of Ajahn Sumedho's teachings we have used only the material\nfrom his talks.\nTachinas from the Forest is a collection of talks given over several\nyears by Ajahn Sumedho at Wat Pah Nanachat (International Forest\nMonastery) in Ubon province, North East Thailand. The conversation\nwith Ajahn Khantipälo and the subsequent three chapters draw from\nAjahn Sumedho's visit in December 1982, and have not been published\nbefore. The chapters \"Budaha, Dhamma, Sangha, 'Ánàpanasati'\" (which\nwas composed from several separate talks on the theme) and \"Happiness,\nUnhappiness and Nibbana\" have appeared before in a small book called\nNow is the Knowing, which was published in 1984 from material gathered\nby the sangha, and in places draws from that same 1982 retreat. This\ncollection presented Ajahn Sumedho's evocative three-line teaching:\n\"Yesterday is a memory; tomorrow is the unknown; now is the knowing'\n- a reminder that was appearing on tee shirts and wall-hangings some\ntwenty-five years later.\nThe last five chapters of Teachings from the Forest are from talks that\nAjahn Sumedho gave in a visit to Wat Pah Nanachat in May 1989. This\ncollection was originally published at Cittaviveka, Chithurst Buddhist\nMonastery in 2005 to mark the completion of Ajahn Sumedho's\nthirty-ninth vassa (his fortieth counting a year as a samanera), and in\nappreciation for his teachings.\nThe Four Noble Truths appeared in 1992. It was a work constructed\nby a lay disciple that drew from some of the Dhamma presentations\nof the Buddha's central teaching that Ajahn Sumedho had given over\nthe years. This teaching of the Four Noble Truths - of suffering, its\ncause, its ceasing and the Path to that ceasing - was the first discourse\nthat the Buddha gave. Hence it has been a recurrent theme in Ajahn\nSumedho's teaching, and forms the heart of his practice.",
